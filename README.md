# etch-a-sketch
This is a turtle graphics etch a sketch app.
This program is a sketch board that allows the user to draw using the Turtle graphics library in Python. The user can move the turtle forward and backward, and turn it left and right using the 'w', 'a', 's' and 'd' keys on the keyboard. Pressing the 'c' key will clear the board and move the turtle back to its starting position.
